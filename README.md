# ND-Annual
North Delta Food Subsidies Study
R scripts are posted here with code for analyzing annual data (water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton) collected for the North Delta Food Subsidies Study. These scripts are used for annual reporting, workplans, presentations, etc. There is a separate repository for the NDFS synthesis study (FASTR).
